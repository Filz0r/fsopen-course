browser->server: user submits the form

note over browser
The following steps explain the logic of how the JavaScript
pushes the request to the server by handling an event and
updating the data on the server
end note
browser->server: the JavaScript event handler parses the form information and sends it to the server
browser->server: then the JavaScript makes a POST request that sends the data to the server
browser->server: finally the JavaScript redraws the notes by simply requesting the updated data.json file
note over server:
finally instead of reloading the page the server simply
sends the updated data.json to the browser
end note
server->browser: Sends the updated data.json to the browser
note over browser
the browser then just refreshes the list that contains the 
notes by using JavaScript instead of having to reload the
entire page and required information
end note
